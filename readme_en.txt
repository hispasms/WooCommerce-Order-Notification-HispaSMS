        **WooCommerce Order Notification HispaSMS - IMPORTANT INFO**

**=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=**

For the correct operation when entering the phone numbers of customers automatically and avoid lost messages in the sms, it is recommended to use a Plugin or Funtion that adds to the field the "Country Code".

We recommend a specific Plugin that is fully compatible with "Wordpress / WooCommerce" and "WooCommerce Order Notification HispaSMS" and automatically generates the Country Code when detecting the user's IP or manually when entering the flag of the country for a more pleasant visualization to the client.

In case you do not want to use a plugin to enter the Country Code in a simple way, you only have to be careful to tell your customers that you must manually enter it when creating the client account.
